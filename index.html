        Triangle Park, located in Richmond’s Church Hill neighborhood, was once
        an abandoned gas station lot. Thanks to dedicated neighbors, it has
        become a thriving community space. The park began with a Chinese Elm and
        two benches salvaged from the former Richmond Coliseum. A raised
        pollinator garden was constucted in 2023 in memory of a neighbor’s
        sister. Now encircled by native plant gardens, Friends of Triangle Park
        continues to maintain and enhance this central greenspace for the
        community and wildlife.
